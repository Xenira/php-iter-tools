Simple PHP library for making working with iterators more fun.

Heavily inspired by rust's iterators.

Currently not all methods are implemented, but the most important ones are. Use with caution.

== Usage

```php
$iterator = new ArrayIterator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
$iterator = $iterator
    ->filter(fn ($value) => $value % 2 === 0)
    ->map(fn ($value) => $value * 2)
    ->take(4);

assert($iterator->collect() === [4, 8, 12, 16]);
```
